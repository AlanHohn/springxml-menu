Spring XML Menus [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AlanHohn/springxml-menu.png)](https://travis-ci.org/AlanHohn/springxml-menu)
======

Illustrates using a Spring custom XML namespace to create Swing menus.

The purpose of this project is to illustrate the components necessary
to make a custom XML namespace with Spring. It is generally not recommended
that you actually make Swing menus this way; unless you have a strong reason
to be able to change the menus without changing Java code, it's much better
to just make them using Java code.
